'''Problem Statement:-
 Rohan das is a fraud by nature. Rohan Das wrote a python function to print a multiplication table of a given number and put one of the values (randomly generated) as wrong.

Rohan Das did this to fool his classmates and make them commit a mistake in a test. You cannot tolerate this!

So you decided to use your python skills to counter Rohan’s actions by writing a python program that validates Rohan’s multiplication table.

Your function should be able to find out the wrong values in Rohan’s table and expose Rohan Das as a fraud.

Note: Rohan’s function returns a list of numbers like this

Rohan Das’s Function Input:
rohanMultiplication(6)

Rohan’s function returns this output:
[6, 12, 18, 26, …., 60]

You have to write a function isCorrect(table, number) and return the index where rohan’s function is wrong and print it to the screen! If the table is correct, your function returns None'''

       else:
           print(number, "*",i,"=",rohan_table[i-1], "(WRONG)  correct number is",number*i)
